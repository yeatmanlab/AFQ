AFQ version 1.2

==============================
Automated Fiber Quantification
==============================

AFQ was designed to generate Tract Profiles of tissue properties for major fiber tracts in healthy and diseased brains. Online documentation can be found at: 
https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ/wiki.  
The current stable release (v1.2) can be downloaded from: 
https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ/archive/v1.2.zip
But it is strongly recommended to following the repository on git. The software is updated regularly.

AFQ has been tested for MATLAB r2009b through MATLAB r2014b. It requires functions from the MATLAB stats toolbox, vistasoft and SPM.
